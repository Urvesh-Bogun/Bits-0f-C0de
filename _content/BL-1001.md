## What is Secure Coding? {#What-is-Secure-Coding}

Secure coding is the practice of writing code that protects against security issues. It ensures that vulnerabilities are minimized, reducing the likelihood of attacks.

---

## 1. Input Validation {#Input-Validation}

**Why:** Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and buffer overflows.

**What to do:**
- Always validate input on both client and server
- Use whitelisting where possible
- Sanitize user inputs to remove harmful characters

---

## 2. Secure Communication {#Secure-Communication}

**Why:** Stops data interception during transit.

**What to do:**
- Enforce HTTPS in app logic
- Use secure HTTP clients
- Validate certificates in your code

---

## 3. Use Trusted Libraries & Frameworks {#Use-Trusted-Libraries}

**Why:** Reduces risks of bugs and known vulnerabilities.

**What to do:**
- Use well-maintained and widely supported libraries
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities

---

## 4. Authentication & Authorization {#Authentication-and-Authorization}

**Why:** Prevents unauthorized access.

**What to do:**
- Implement robust identity and access checks
- Enforce permissions in the backend, not just frontend
- Apply the principle of least privilege in your logic

---

## 5. Password Handling {#Password-Handling}

**Why:** Prevents account takeovers.

**What to do:**
- Never store passwords in plain text
- Always hash passwords with a secure algorithm
- Use salts to strengthen hashes
- Never log sensitive credential data

---

## 6. Avoid Hardcoded Secrets {#Avoid-Hardcoded-Secrets}

**Why:** Prevents accidental credential leaks.

**What to do:**
- Do not hardcode API keys, secrets, or credentials
- Use environment variables
- Load secrets securely at runtime

---

## 7. Error Handling & Logging {#Error-Handling-and-Logging}

**Why:** Prevents leaking sensitive information.

**What to do:**
- Provide generic error messages to end-users
- Log errors internally with necessary context
- Mask any sensitive information in logs
- Avoid exposing stack traces or database errors in responses

---

## Conclusion {#Conclusion}

Security starts in the code. These practices help prevent vulnerabilities before they
become real threats.
